# KIT-RBT-OA

Everyone loves mobile robot :) This is mobile robot kit based on Maker UNO(Arduino UNO compatible). Learning electronics, sensor, microcontroller and coding together, not to forget having fun too!

The kit comes in loose parts, so you will need to assemble it, but no soldering is needed. What's so special about this mobile robot kit is it has ultrasonic sensor  where you can program it for obstacble detection and perform obstacle avoidance. And we have prepared the steps for you to assemble it and sample sketch based on Arduino for your robot to avoid bumping into obstacle while navigating.

With the beginner friendly Maker UNO as the controller, everyone can build and program this mobile robot. We have also included dual channel motor driver, with custom designed acrylic base + two "TT" brush motor. Not to forget we also include 4 x AA battery to power the controller and motor. Of course it has Bluetooth module too :)
